# MNIST Data Filtering and Padding

This project demonstrates the application of filtering and padding techniques on the MNIST dataset, a collection of handwritten digits. The goal is to preprocess the data by applying filters to enhance the images and using padding to ensure the dimensions are consistent for machine learning tasks.

## Features
- **Filter Application**: This project applies various filters to the MNIST dataset images to enhance their features, such as edge detection, sharpening, and blurring.
- **Padding**: Padding is applied to images to make sure they have uniform dimensions, which is crucial for many machine learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before running the code:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for working with MNIST data)
- OpenCV (for applying filters)
- Matplotlib (for visualizing the images)

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
